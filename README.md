## ‚ö° Known Limitations/Trade-offs
1. State Management:
- The app uses React's useState and useMemo for local state management.
For larger applications, a more robust solution like Redux or Zustand might be required.
- For larger applications, a more robust solution like Redux or Zustand might be required.

2. Accessibility:
- Current drag-and-drop functionality may not fully meet accessibility standards.
 Improvements are needed for users with disabilities, including screen reader and keyboard navigation support.

# Performance:
- Optimized for small to medium-sized boards.
- May experience performance degradation with a large number of tasks and columns.

## üöß Future Improvements
- Integrate a state management library like Redux or Zustand for better handling of complex state interaction.
- Add backend support to persist data and enable multi-user collaboration.
- Enhance accessibility with keyboard navigation and screen reader support for drag-and-drop features.
- Introduce unit and integration tests to ensure reliability and maintainability.
- Elevate the UI/UX with advanced animations, transitions, and a more polished design.
